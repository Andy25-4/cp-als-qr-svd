# cp-als-qr-svd

This code is based on the CP_ALS function in the MATLAB Tensor Toolbox from Sandia Corporation, which can be found at http://www.tensortoolbox.org/. The citation is Brett W. Bader, Tamara G. Kolda and others. MATLAB Tensor Toolbox Version 2.6, Available online, February 2015.

The cp_als_qr function solves for the CP-decomposition of a tensor in CP-ALS algorithm using the QR-decompositon for improved numerical stability.

The cp_als_qr_svd function additionally uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) for further stability.

This is part of my computer science honors project at Wake Forest University.
